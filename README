OE4T Boot Logo

This repository hosts pre-cooked bitmaps used for the default bootlogo-custom
implementation.

These were generated from the OE4T logo with the following imagemagick command:

    convert.im7 ${_input_file} \
        -type truecolor \
        -colorspace RGB \
        -resize ${W}x${H}\> \
        -gravity center \
        -background ${SPLASH_GRAPHIC_BACKGROUND} \
        -extent ${W}x${H} ${B}/logo-${H}.bmp

Note the format of the config_file differs slightly from that used by the L4T
genbmpblob_L4T.sh script. The config_file used by L4T should not have semicolon
line endings.
